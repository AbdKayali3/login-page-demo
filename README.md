# Login-page demo using HTML & CSS
- This is a simple login-page demo using HTML & CSS
- I could have used Bootstrap or Tailwind but I wanted to show my CSS skills without using any library
- I have used CSS Flexbox for the layout
- Tablet and mobile responsive
- Vertical and horizontal centering for laptop and desktop
- CSS variables are used for colors and fonts
